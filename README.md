GitHub Pages Demonstration
=============

This repository is a bare-bones Jekyll site hosted on GitHub Pages. The goal is to help demonstrate some cool features you get when you host your site using GitHub pages. For example, your site has direct access to some GitHub metadata. No need to make extra requests to the GitHub API.

I wrote a blog post that goes into more detail about this.
